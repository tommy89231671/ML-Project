1. Random Date Generator 
     a. univariate gaussian data generator 
          INPUT: expectation value (m), variance (s)
          OUTPUT: one outcome ~ N(m, s)
          HINT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Generating_values_from_normal_distribution
          NOTE: you have to handcraft your geneartor based on one of the approaches given in the hint.

     b. polynomial basis linear model (y = WTPhi(x)+e ; e ~ N(0, a)) data generator
          INPUT: basis number (n; ex. n=2 -> y = w0x0 +w1x1), a, w
          OUTPUT: y
          NOTE: there is an internal constraint: -10.0 < x < 10.0, x is uniformly distributed.

2. Sequential estimate the mean and variance from the data given from the univariate gaussian data generator (1.a).
        NOTE: you should derive the recursive function of mean and variance based on the sequential esitmation. 
        INPUT: m, s as in (1.a)
        FUNCTION: call (1.a) to get a new data point from N(m, s), use sequential estimation to find the current estimates to m and s., repeat until the estimates converge.
        OUTPUT: print the new data point and the current estimiates of m and s in each iteration.

3. Baysian Linear regression
      INPUT: the precision (i.e., b) for initial prior w ~ N(0, b-1I) and all other required inputs for the polynomial basis linear model geneartor (1.b)
      FUNCTION: call 1.b to generate one data point, and update the prior. and calculate the paramters of predictive distribution, repeat until the posterior probability converges.
      OUTPUT: print the new data point and the current paramters for posterior and predictive distribution.
      HINT: It is not that hard.
